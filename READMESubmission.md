**About the Product**

As per our research, we saw that a huge percentage of auto insurance claims are rejected without even justification and there have been situations when the Surveyor was not able to reach the location at that certain moment due to which the claim procedure faced some issues. So what if we made the process easier. Now you could easily apply a claim from wherever you are, provide the details and the images, attend a small video call and provide all the documents and proofs from your side which would make the life of the Surveyor much similar and help you get an easy claim for the damage caused.

# **Implementation**

## Claim Process

AutoSure provides you with a very easy flow where the User would have to enter his Vehicle details like the registration, Insurance No. etc so that we can register his Vehicle onto our service and If they ever have to apply for their claim what they would have to do is click on the vehicle they want to apply a claim for, and then fill in the details, and click onsite images which would help our system analyze and compare those images with the existing uploaded images and then based on it a Surveyor would be allocated to them who would verify and rectify the situation using our video call feature which has been integrated into our system to cross-check and verify the claims provided by the user. In the end, the Surveyor would decide if the claim should further on or not.

## Surveyor

Surveyor is an authorized person who verifies and checks the situation and then based on the data which he has, he would accept or reject the Claim.

## **Business Model**

The global auto insurance market size was valued at $739.30 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $1.06 trillion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2020 to 2027.

> During COVID-19, the pay-as-you-drive policy is expected to provide lucrative opportunities for auto insurance companies as it allows car owners to insure their vehicles for kilometers they tend to drive instead of the average that everyone is supposed to drive for, in a full year.

We can charge the organization or the user with 1% fees, which according to our estimations is about approximately $9.8 billion dollar.
